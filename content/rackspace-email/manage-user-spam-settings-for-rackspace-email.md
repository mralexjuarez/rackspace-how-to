This article describes how to manage individual user spam settings and how to save your configuration.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).
2. Click the **Go to section** menu and select **Domains**.
3. In the **Spam Filtering** section, click the **Filter Settings**.
4. If you have multiple domains, select a domain name. Or, to change domains at any time, click the **change domain**.
5. In the **Status** section, turn spam filtering on or off. Or, select **Exclusive** to receive email only from senders on the safelist.
6. If you turned spam filtering on, indicate how messages should be handled for Rackspace Email:

    - **Deliver to Spam folder** - Spam messages are sent to the user's Spam folder. If you want to automatically delete messages from this folder, select the **Delete after *n* days or *n* total email** check box and enter a specified number of days or total emails.
    - **Delete the email immediately** - Spam email will be deleted automatically and not delivered to the user's mailbox. Email will be permanently deleted and will not be retrievable.
    -   **Include "\[SPAM\]" at the beginning of the subject line** - Spam email
    will be delivered to the user's Inbox, but will include the text "\[SPAM\]" in the Subject line.
    - **Deliver to the email address** - Spam messages are sent to an address in your domain that you specify.

7. If you turned spam filtering on, indicate how messages should be handled for Microsoft Exchange:

    - **Send spam to the quarantine for this recipient** - Each Exchange mailbox
    has its own Quarantine Manager, located in the User Control Panel.
    (Users can log in to the User Control Panel at <https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp>, using their Exchange email address and password.) Email that is filtered as spam will be
    directed to the Quarantine Manager, where the user can then view and
    delete quarantined emails, or mark them as **Not Spam**.
    - **Send spam to domain quarantine** - Spam will be directed to the
    domain-level quarantine, rather than to the individual Quarantine
    Manager for the mailbox.

      **Note:** To log in to the domain-level Quarantine Manager, click the **Log
into the Quarantine Manager** link. Email that is filtered as spam will be directed to the domain-level Quarantine Manager, where the administrator can then view and delete quarantined emails, or mark them as **Not Spam**.

    - **Send quarantine notifications to** - If you choose to send spam to the
    user's quarantine, they will receive quarantine updates by default.
    To receive email updates at an additional address, enter an email
    address in the **Send quarantine notifications to** box.

8. Set override options by choosing one of the following options:

   - **Set preferences only for users who have not set their own** - This default selection manually toggles the settings on this page and does not affect any current ongoing spam filter settings for other mailboxes.
   - **Override preferences for all users regardless of their own preferences** - This option manually toggles the settings on this page when you select the radio button and click **Save**. It does not stay enabled, and it only serves as a one-time update for the preferences.

9. Click the **Save** button.
